In short, the `WsConversationHandler` function is responsible for managing WebSocket connections within a conversation. Here's a summary of what it does:

1. It retrieves the conversation ID from the WebSocket connection parameters.
2. It ensures thread safety by locking access to the `clients` map.
3. It adds the WebSocket connection to the map of clients for the respective conversation.
4. It retrieves existing messages for the conversation and sends them to the client.
5. It enters a loop to continuously read messages from the client.
6. When a message is received, it processes the message metadata and file data.
7. It saves the message media (image, video, audio, PDF) to the file system or external storage.
8. It broadcasts the message to all clients in the same conversation.

Overall, this function facilitates real-time messaging within a conversation by handling WebSocket connections, message processing, and broadcasting messages to connected clients.
